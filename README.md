# Coming Soon Template

A neat little template created for a "Coming soon" landing page - this version is the most recent update.

-----------------------

### What's changed?

*     Added Extra secion ("Social Links)
*     Added footer for credits
*     Made us of Flat Social icons (http://speckyboy.com/2013/09/16/freebie-flat-social-icon-set/)
*     Tidy up of some internal code

There may still be a few little errors with this version, hence why it's still under a branch - once it's error-free it'll be pushed
in to the master copy.
